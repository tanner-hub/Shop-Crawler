# Shop-Crawler
<shop crawler is an online automation tool that I developed using Angular and Python hosted on a Linux server running Apache Tomcat and Flask. The application was designed to step through a list of available sites (10-20 million) and log statistical data about the sites availability and response times. When response was recognized as high, the application would step through the site collecting information using automated docker bots running Selenium (not too many, about 20-30 as weâ€™re not trying to DDOS anyone). Much of the collected data was processed using Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and Matplotlib.>
